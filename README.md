## Book-Recommendation-Engine-using-KNN

Welcome to our Book Recommendation System! Our system employs collaborative filtering to suggest books based on your past ratings and the ratings of other users. It offers a personalized approach to discovering new reads that align with your interests.

To ensure high-quality recommendations, we filter out users with fewer than 200 ratings and books with fewer than 100 ratings. This ensures that the books recommended to you are popular and well-received by a substantial number of readers.

If you're looking to explore new books that resonate with your reading preferences, our system is here to help. Simply input a book title you've enjoyed, and we'll find similar books that you're likely to love.
